    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am an experienced software engineer with expertise in SRE and database system. For the past few years, 
      I have been working at NAVER Corp, where I have led an engineering team and developed integrated SRE systems. 
      My current focus is on building and maintaining a global-scale time-series database platform based on 
      VictoriaMetrics. I have a strong command of programming languages such as Python, C and Java, and 
      I have presented talks and interviews on my work in Korean.
      
      During my master's degree program, I focused my research on recommender systems, which has given me a strong 
      foundation in this area. My experience in both academia and industry has equipped me with a unique skill set 
      that combines technical expertise with strategic thinking, making me a valuable asset to any team.

          Since September 2022, I have been building and maintaining a global-scale time-series database platform based 
          on VictoriaMetrics. The platform consists of hundreds of physical machines and Kubernetes pods, and it is 
          challenging to deal with tens of millions of timeseries on a simple tech stack. I presented a talk about the 
          platform in detail, titled 
          ["VictoriaMetrics: Time series in the Multiverse of Madness"](https://deview.kr/2023/sessions/558) in Korean.
          
          From 2020 to the beginning of 2022, I led an engineering team that developed an integrated SRE system.
          The team started with two members, including me, and grew to a team of nine. During my tenure,
          I presented a talk and gave a media interview about the team's story.
          The talk was titled ["Search Engine and SRE Platform for Global Web Search System"](https://tv.naver.com/v/20312678)
          in Korean, and the interview article was titled
          ["[네이버 어벤저스] 검색 장애율 0%대 ‘철통방어선’은 바로 이곳"](https://n.news.naver.com/article/138/0002102957) in Korean.
          
          From 2017 to 2019, I implemented an SRE system that includes functions such as monitoring, alerting, etc.
          I had to define various functions, roles, and strategies. I presented a talk about my work titled
          ["SRE: Search Reliability Engineering"](https://deview.kr/2018/schedule/253) in Korean.

      - role: Software Engineer
        time: 2016 - 2017
        company: TmaxSoft Inc., Republic of Korea
        details: |
          I developed [Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)](https://www.tmaxsoft.com/products/tibero/) and 
          worked on query compiler and executor, particularly in JOIN and GROUP BY algorithms with hash-related features. 
          Additionally, I participated in developing an RDBMS monitoring product, primarily using C and Java as 
          programming languages.
